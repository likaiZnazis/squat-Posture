#What I need
"""""
Let's assume that we have a folder where are 12 csv files.
We need to rename each of the files to 1-Set.csv, 2-Set.csv etc
Need to log each of the files preprocessing where are segments made.
These segments are placed insdie a single file.

#Steps
'''
FIRST: need to understand where to place the file. I don't want to change the path each time.
For example if I pull this git to a different PC then it would create a folder and place these csv files.
-Place it inside the project direcotry. This happens on github ;/

SECOND: need to go over each of the files and get segments of those files.
Log information about the segments and append them to the main csv file.
